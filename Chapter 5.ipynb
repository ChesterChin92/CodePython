    "### Chapter 5 – Instructor Notes\n",
    "###### Instruction to Trainer – \n",
    "This chapter is slightly different from the rest of the chapters. \n",
    "It discusses more about the strategy used to approach and solve a problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Objectives of Chapter 5\n",
    "1. Apply for loops in practical questions. \n",
    "2. Understand there are more than one way of solving a problem. (Brute force typically is looping, recursive loop, iteration.)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Scope\n",
    "1.\tDemo Codes should not exceed 30 lines.\n",
    "2.  Students are **Not** required to fully understand **ALL** strategy, basic understanding will do. \n",
    "3.  Student should focus more on how to select the right strategy to solve the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Assistant Level\n",
    "1.\tInstructors are advised to not give away the answers to the student. \n",
    "2.\tAvoid tell them which line is causing an error. (As python had already did, student should be able to figure it out themselves.)\n",
    "3.\tCommon errors are typos or extra spacing.\n",
    "4.\tCommon confusion between double quotes “  and single quotes ‘ in python shell. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Common mistakes\n",
    "1. Indentation. Codes that belong under a certain function needs to be indented.\n"
