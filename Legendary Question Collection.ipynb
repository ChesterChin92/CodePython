    "### Fitting in\n",
    "A box manufacturing company is facing an issue, that have a customer that always order a random yet specific size for the box. The box is used to put fruits in the box. However, as you know different fruit have different type of size.\n",

    "Fruits | Space\n",
    "---|---\n",
    "Grapes | 1 Space\n",
    "Orange | 2 Space \n",
    "Durian | 10 Space\n",
    "Papaya | 15 Space\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 1.**\n",
    "Every time the customer requires a different size of box to fit his fruits. Now here comes the challenge. \n",
    "If he has 2 grapes, 2 oranges and 2 Durians. What is the size of the box he needs?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*(LOL, that one is your average secondary school math question.)*\n",

    "**Part 2.**\n",
    "Here goes the real challenge. \n",
    "\n",
    "Say the customer wants a box with the size of X (Example 100 Spaces), write a program that can tell the customer how many combinations of fruits that he can best fit into the box. \n",
    "\n",
    "*(Nah, thatâ€™s not super hard.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 3.**\n",
    "Ultimate challenge. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each fruits have its own selling price and special condition. Shown as bellow. \n",

    "| Papaya      | 15 | Rm35 |None|\n",

    "\n",

    "Improve the program that you wrote previously, improve it so that it considers the condition above and return a result to the customers on the **best possible combination** that **_yields the best selling price_**.\n",
